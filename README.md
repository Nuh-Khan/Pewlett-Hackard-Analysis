The data will be gathered from several sources and, to ensure data integrity, employee ID will be used as the primary key throughout the analysis. The most recent role of each employee will be considered to avoid duplicate data.

## Summary

### Important questions
- Should all eligible employees decide to retire this year, the company would need to fill 72,458 positions.
- With a mere 1,940 employees eligible for the current mentorship program, the company may face a significant knowledge gap in the near future. This situation calls for dedicating resources to ensure the maintenance of existing service standards.

### Additional Queries
To gain further insights as Pewlett-Hackard prepares for a wave of retirements, the following additional queries can be utilized:

- Analyzing salary data could enable the company to evaluate the gap between salary adjustments for retiring employees and market rates for new hires. This insight can inform budget decisions related to new hires, internal promotions, incentivizing key employees to stay as mentors, or investing in technology to potentially phase out redundant roles.
- By scrutinizing employee and department data, the company can pinpoint the departments that will be most impacted by the impending retirement wave and juxtapose them with departments that have mentorship-eligible employees. This approach offers a more holistic view of where resources should be directed to effectively navigate the forthcoming changes.
